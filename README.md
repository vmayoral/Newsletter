### [How to save project costs and improve quality with digital twins](https://www.etmm-online.com/how-to-save-project-costs-and-improve-quality-with-digital-twins-a-1102254/)
The virtual commissioning of customer-specific machines has the greatest leverage in terms of improving product quality, costs and throughput time. Until now, model creation has been costly and uneconomical due to the lack of mechatronic modular building block systems. Let's take a look at the effects of digital twins for virtual commissioning.

### [MIT's mini cheetah sets new speed PB by learning from experience](https://newatlas.com/robotics/mits-mini-cheetah-breaks-speed-record-learning-experience/)
MIT's mini cheetah robot has broken its own personal best (PB) speed, hitting 8.72 mph (14.04 km/h) thanks to a new model-free reinforcement learning system that allows the robot to figure out on its own the best way to run and allows it to adapt to different terrain, without relying on human analysis.

### [3 Questions: How the MIT mini cheetah learns to run](https://news.mit.edu/2022/3-questions-how-mit-mini-cheetah-learns-run-fast-0317)
CSAIL scientists came up with a learning pipeline for the four-legged robot that learns to run entirely by trial and error in simulation.

### [Serve, Nvidia Formalize Partnership with $10M Investment](https://foodondemandnews.com/03172022/serve-nvidia-formalize-partnership-with-10m-investment/)
Serve Robotics announced a new investment from chipmaker Nvidia that deepens the relationship between the two companies and helps speed up growth and development.
Nvidia will invest $10 million in the company as a strategic investment. Among investments in the robotic food delivery space, it’s not massive, but it’s important for a few reasons.

### [Nvidia’s GTC Provides A Glimpse At A World Full Of Autonomous Machines](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tiriasresearch/2022/03/18/nvidias-gtc-provides-a-glimpse-at-a-world-full-of-autonomous-machines/?sh=581502f714ca)
There are a few must-attend technology conferences, even when they are held virtually. One of those is Nvidia’s GPU Technology Conference more commonly known as GTC. While holding the conference virtually does limit the interaction with the broad array of attendees from industry, government, and academia, it still provides an invaluable glimpse into advancements in accelerated processing technology, graphics, and artificial intelligence (AI).

### [Intel Announces World’s Fastest FPGAs with in-package HBM: The Intel Agilex M-Series FPGAs](https://www.eejournal.com/article/intel-announces-worlds-fastest-fpgas-with-in-package-hbm-the-intel-agilex-m-series-fpgas/)
Intel has just introduced the Agilex M-Series FPGAs with support for PCIe Gen5, Optane persistent memory, CXL, and high-speed Ethernet. Some of the FPGAs in the Agilex M-Series also incorporate integrated High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) DRAM stacks. FPGAs with integrated HBM DRAM stacks are not new. Both Intel and AMD-Xilinx have offered such devices for a few years. Xilinx announced its first FPGAs with integrated HBM, the Virtex UltraScale+ HBM FPGAs, in late 2016, although parts didn’t appear until early 2018. Intel’s first-generation FPGA family with integrated HBM2 DRAM stacks were the Intel Stratix 10 MX FPGAs, announced in late 2018. The Agilex M-Series FPGAs incorporate the latest, fastest, 3rd-generation HBM2e DRAM stacks. These are the same in-package DRAM stacks being used to boost performance in the Fourth Generation Intel Xeon Scalable “Sapphire Rapids” CPUs and the Intel Ponte Vecchio GPU.
